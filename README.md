This is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that simulates a natural language data querying dashboard for a Gen AI-powered analytics tool. It allows users (especially non-technical teams) to input questions in plain English and view results instantly through interactive charts – helping them make quick, data-driven decisions.
 Features:
 Natural language input with basic AI suggestion simulation

 => Query history tracking previous inputs

=> Mock data visualization with charts (using Recharts)

 => Loading and error states to simulate real-world API behavior

 => Global state management with Redux

 => Responsive and clean UI

 Technologies Used
React.js – Frontend framework

Redux Toolkit – For state management

Tailwind CSS – Styling and layout

Recharts – Data visualization

# 1. Clone the repo

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start the development server
npm start

As a fresher, my goal was to focus on clean code, modular components, and a smooth user flow. Here's a brief on how I tackled the challenge:

Created reusable components to keep things clean and scalable.

Used Redux to manage query input, processing status, results, and history.

Simulated an AI-like query interaction with setTimeout and mock responses.

Used Recharts to display fake data visually and interactively.

Made sure the app is responsive and user-friendly across devices.

 UI/UX Inspiration
For UI inspiration, I referred to modern dashboards from Behance and Dribbble, focusing on:

Minimal layout

Clear typography

Easy-to-navigate structure
